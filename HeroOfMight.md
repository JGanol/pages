# Hero of might

*- My Princess, I will save you!* - A Knight raised up the Diamond Sword to announce the attack.

Waves and waves of a huge army - griffins, mages, dark riders, golems, centaurs, cyclops, hydras, troglodytes, liches, manticores, efreets, firebirds, mummies, and harpies - flooded Castle walls. The assault began.

Dozens of hands and paws started rocking a ram. Wooden gates accompanied blows with groaning. A hundred of onagers lined up in front of impregnable stone walls. A roar of the Demon Horn woke up hundred of fire stones. Like hungry hawks, they rushed towards sieged Castle. The air mingled victories cries of the Knight's army with doomed sobs of defenders. Smoke turned day into night. The last battle, the greatest battle blossomed with blood like a red rose. Every sword, every ax and arrow found its target. Draw it in your mind, let fear burn your skin, leave you dying millions of deaths.  The last battle, the greatest battle...

Eventually, as a sun vanished from a horizon, the battle voices also died out. Ash, blood, and urine were what was left. The defenders softly groaned from mortal wounds. The Knight's warriors wearily lowered their swords and bows, unfastened their armor or what was left of it, and found rest where they stood. As the last who remanded standing won, right?

There was not a single warrior capable to attack or defend. The Knight jumped off his horse and ran, no, flew like an arrow up the stairs. The Diamond Sword was gleefully tapping the steps.

Here is the arch door to the throne room. The Knight threw it wide open, drew his Sword out of its scabbard, and burst in.

*- Here am I! Show yourself! Fair fight for the Princess!* - the Sword gleamed in a twilight.

**Bam!** A pretty handmade pillow left a dotted mark on the Knight's face.

*- Oh cool down, Neonius!*

The Knight glanced at the pillow. Then looked at the Princess. Then again at the pillow. At the Princess. Frowned. Scratched his stubbled cheek.

*- My Princess...* - bleated the surprised Knight, - *Trinitia! You are...free?*

*- I see I am free, but what's the point?* - the Princess viciously glared at the Knight.

She followed onto a balcony, and holding her arm at an angle of seventy-three degrees to a horizon, sighed:

*- Look, look what you have done!*

The Knight lowered the Sword to the marble floor. Followed by a rumble of his armor, the Knight crossed the hall and squinted at a blurring point in the sky.

*- Yes?* - muttered he, uncertain whether he could approach his beautiful Princess any closer.

*- Are you blind or what?*

*"No",* - he thought, - *"not the right time."*

*- Oh sorry, give me a second...*

The Knight weakened his chest plate to reach his bosom. Rummaged to the left, and then to the right.

*- Found!* - and he pulled out gold-framed glasses. You know, your sight goes worse from swinging a diamond sword constantly.

The stone walls of the Castle reflected the Knight's horrified cry...

***

A pimpled face was looking at a monitor screen and smiling.

*- Danny,* - came a voice from a kitchen, - *dear, dinner is ready.*

*- Moment, mom, I'm coming!*

Danny has passed the mission. He enjoyed the game!

A computer froze in anticipation: *"Do you want to quit? Yes? No?"*

***

*- This boy, now, will tap "yes" - and we are gone!* - lamented the Princess. - *It's all because of you! Who asked you to save me? The map is big enough - go find some more treasures. We all would live happily long enough... Yes, long. Just long,* - she fixed her curly hair. - *I would embroider pillows, tablecloths, tapestries... How unfair! I am so young for this!*

The Princess stretched out her thin arms, begging the pimpled god not to turn off the world.

*- My Fair Princess,* - muttered the Knight. - *Let us then honor this last minute with a passionate kiss!*

The Knight folded his lips in a form of a bow and took a chance to reach his Princess.

*-You F-O-O-L!* - and another handmade pillow was imprinted on the Knight's lips.
