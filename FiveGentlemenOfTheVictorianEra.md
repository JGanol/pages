# Five gentlemen of the Victorian era

Origin: [Пять джентельменов викторианской эпохи](http://samlib.ru/g/ganolx_j_w/5_dzhentlmenov.shtml) *25-02-2009*

One unremarkable evening the honorable sirs Adam Ashman, Brian Backford, Conor Carter, David Double, and Edward Exton decided to do something remarkable, something suitable to young gentlemen of high society. And so it happened that this bright thought came to them that hour and minute when they were passing by a pub with a wooden plate "Green beard".

*- My friends, listen,* - said sir Ashman. - *Shouldn't we celebrate this...wonderful weather in the "Beard"? I insist!*

*- Excellent idea, sir Ashman,* - sir Backford immediately caught the spirit. - *I have high hopes missis Wibley-Willington has a table for us. A dozen mugs of London Porter would make this evening unforgettable.*

*- Your idea, sir Backford,* - mused sir Carter, - *to my mind is the best.*

Sir Double nodded thoughtfully, and sir Exton rushed to open a door, bowing obligingly to his friends as they disappear in the welcoming darkness of the pub.

***

*- I am glad to admit,* - began sir Ashman, - *that I am among enlightened minds. It is so difficult to meet friends with a bowler hat these days. I am delighted and honored!*

He lifted his mug and banged it loudly against sirs Backford's and Carter's. One third of dark porter splashed at once onto the table. Sir Exton glanced triumphantly at his pint that survived the toast. So as sir Double, who stuck his nose into foam to escape congratulations of his friend.

*- I'm not finished,* - tore sir Ashman sir Double's nose off his mug. - *Let's raise our mugs for this...wonderful weather and our subtle flair, helping us to grasp the beauty of the nature.*

And he, overwhelmed by positive emotions, drove into the mug of sir Exton. Sir Double hastily raised his hand and gulped down all the beer.

*- Bravo, sir Double,* - roared sir Carter. - *There is always room for one more pint in a healthy body. Missis Wibley-Willington, your mugs are too small for our friend. Bring him more of your porter! And don't forget us.*

Sir Backford whistled approvingly, and slapped sir Double on his back. The nose of the latest dived into foam, causing a round of applause from the honorable gentlemen.

***

*- For England! For Queen Victoria!*

*- For missis Wibley-Willington and her excellent porter!*

*- For the sun shining over London and this warm evening!*

*- For you and me, dear friends!*

*- For our ladies!* - added sir Backford.

*- And for the luck they don't see us now!* - noted sir Carter.

None of cheerful friends were going to be left behind in amount of pints per a honorable gentleman. Sir Ashman completely soaked his beard and mustaches. The hand of sir Carter got tired to conduct, beckoning missis Wibley-Willington now and then. Sir Exton, feeling raise of degree, tried to jump out of his socks and jacket, but luckily got saved by sir Double. Between intense gestures and cries sir Double also successfully avoided one or two friendly pushes from sir Carter. Sir Backford was proud of himself - he managed to save six of eight pints in a battle called "mug up and clink".

***

*- I believe, dear sirs,* - sir Backford barely moved his tongue, - *today we have given enough praise to the Queen and weather.*

*- And to ladies, that are not with us,* - came from under sir Exton's jacket; the gentleman himself fought enough with sleeves and linings for tonight, and was being resting.

*-I proclaim this meeting of noble members of society to be, hick, closed,* - summed sir Backford.

Sir Double rumbled something in agreement, to which sir Carter nodded and made an adventurous attempt to get off a table.

*- On a horse! And straight home!* - called he and fell at the feel of the "Green beard"'s owner.

*- You honorable sirs,* - addressed missis Wibley-Willington her yellow-toothed smile to sir Carter. - *Won't you bother first pay, and then of cause leave with all the honors to beds?*

She is so sweet, thought sir Carter.

*- Please, sirs, only 25 pounds and 10 shillings. And something to thank missis Wibley-Willington, for whom you so cordially were raising your mugs,* - she added and smiled to sirs present at the table.

*- Of course, needless to say,* - gibbered sir Ashman; he turned to be the most sober spilling more beer than others. - *Sir Exton, Edward, my friend, you won't believe! I forgot my wallet at home. Can you pay, buddy?*

*- A-l-l r-i-g-h-t,* - sir Exton made an effort to find pockets in his jacket. - *What a pity! If ever I had pockets, I would find pounds there. But I also forgot them somewhere at home. Sir Backford, do us a favor.*

*- Certainly! Any time. But not today. You see, my uncle will sponsor me the first day next month, not earlier. Fortunately i have no doubts in our sir Carter.*

*- Sir Carter,* - sternly remarked sir Carter, - *managed to exchange a few crunchy papers for a ring for miss Cecilia Kingsbury today. And couldn't make it to a bank on time. But I saw there our sir Double, luckily to all us.*

Sir Double drearly glanced at his for friends, whom a tricky fate entrusted to him.

*- Well...*

*- Well, well, well,* - resented missis Wibley-Willington. - *Our gentlemen are broke tonight?! The beginning was very promising though - your praises were heard in the Buckingham Palace. Oh well. How can i demand money from such honorable men.*

Sir Backford made a sigh of relief.

*- Nevertheless...*

Sir Backford hiccuped and held his breath.

*- ...I am expecting 30 pounds,* - she waved her finger in front of sir Carter's nose. - *You heard right, sir. THIRTY. Here is missis Wibley-Willington's arichmetics. 25 pounds 10 shillings for London Porter. Yes? And 10 more shillings for the short performance you confused me with searching your money in your friend's pockets. Plus 4 pounds as your gratitude for my patience. 30 pounds by the 1st of August. And god bless your uncle, sir, and his good memory.*

*- You are so kind, dear missis Wibley-Willington,* - lamented sir Ashman and sir Exton in unison.

*- Wait a little bit, my dears,* - she stopped the chorus of the young men. - *There is one more condition...*

Here sir Double interrupted the conversation - he sighed resignedly, accepting one more condition.

*- Where was I?* - went on missis Wibley-Willington. - *You will take a kitten.*

*- A kitten?!* - sir Ashman clutched at his heart. - *Excuse me, madam. What does a fluffy animal have to do with it? His place is in a circus, not in hands of noble sirs!*

*- You will take a kitten with you,* - continued missis Wibley-Willington in a strict voice. - *In a month whoever has a kitten pays the bill. And be gentle with the animal, or each of you will pay 30 pounds,* - she smiled the sweetest smile. - *For now i wish you good night, gentlemen. Let me just bring Missy,* - and she retired to a back room.

Our noble sirs, not wasting time and jackets, retreated out of the pub. There they called a halt, looked back if they were been chased, and sighed with a relief.

*- We seem to have survived,* - noted sir Ashman.

*- I afraid not, we lost sir Exton,* - said sir Carter.

*- What a pity! But I believe our friend can stand for himself,* - concluded sir Backford. - *I am not a minute in double in him. And it is time for me to leave.*

*- As well as for me and sirs Carter and Double,* - agreed sir Ashman. - *Good night, gentlemen! Night, night!*

***

*- Oh,* - groaned sir Exton.

*- Sir?* - asked his valet politely.

*- Oh...* - replied young gentleman.

*- Sir? I understand it is not the right moment to ask, but how would you like me to dispose with the basket you brought yesterday? Or was it today? Sir? It is meowing.*

*- Oh!...*

*- Let me give it some milk. I believe it will appreciate some care,* - and without awaiting more "oh"-s he left.

It took sir Exton some time to start his day. As he dressed and opened a door, an insistent meow came from a hallway.

*- Oh?*

*- Sir? Would you like to take a walk with this cute fluffy creature?* - asked an old lady, who was renting out rooms to sir Exton.

*- Eh, yes,* - showed sir Exton some originality in conversation.

***

A gentleman walked along Hyde Park, caring a basket.

*- What a lovely pussy,* - admitted misses and missises.

Ladies were eagerly touching the fluffy ball. The ball meowed and purred, that unfortunately didn't make sir Exton any happier. He wandered without any particular destination, and dreamt of becoming fluffy himself, so no one will put a bill of 30 pounds for him to pay.

*- Meow,* - in a fit of despair sir Exton turned to a stout old lady with an umbrella.

*- What an impudent one!* - exclaimed the lady and hurried up to pull her hand away from the basket.

Sir Exton left the park in a hurry, or that old lady could have called a policeman to arrest him. Feet brought him at sir Double's house.

*- What a stroke of luck!* - smiled sir Exton for the first time in a day.

He looked over his right then left shoulder. No one was watching him sneaking to the back door and carefully placing a meowing basket on a rug. He almost turned around a corner, leaving a crime scene, when returned back, made a few abrupt breaths and knocked.

***

*- Who's there Lewis?* - sir Double called from his cabinet.

*- No one, sir, just...*

A demanding meow intervented the conversation.

*- Damn it Lewis, where did you get this basket?!*

*- Sir, may i assume some nimble messenger devilered it. I heard a persistent knock, but the boy had gone long before i opened the door. The street both ways was empty.*

*- Lewis, take the basket to the post office!* - roared sir Double.

*- Yes sir. What address should i send it to?*

*- Sorry?* - sir Double was already back to his papers.

*- Whom is the basket for, sir?*

*- Oh yes... Send it...Send it...* - sir Double was guessing who is the best recipient and a possible sender. - *To my dearest friend sir Conor Carter. And let a postman know that any kind of baskets, boxes or animals addressed to me should be returned to a sender unpacked.*

*-Yes, sir.*

***

*- Sir, the is a package for you.*

*- Oh, Emmy, what are you waiting for, bring it to me,* - hurried his maiden sir Carter.

*- I must notice, sir, that you're allergic. It is not for good...*

*- What is there, Emmy?* - sir Carter got suspicious.

*- A cat, sir. No-no, a kitten, so cute, so fluffy...*

*- Non a word any more!* - howled the noble sir.

*- Yes, sir. I knew, sir, i shouldn't have...* - muttered the maiden.

*- Get rid of it, Emmy!*

*- Yes, sir...*

***

Three days later sir Carter was measuring his apartment with a pen and a paper, humming something about "A girl made a pie, and it wasn't with poppy". The rhyme wasn't a complex topic for him. But tonight poppy sticked only to sloppy and nothing else. Suddenly he stopped heeding to a silence.

*- Meow,* - came from somewhere in the apartment.

*- Meow?!* - sir Carter made a grimace.

Another sound brought him to a door of his maiden. The feeling of anxiety took place of pies and poppies.

*- Emmy, are you there?* - a lace bonnet appeared in a tiny crack between the door and its frame.

*- Emmy, my dear. I am probably wrong, but i sensed "meow" from this same door. Can you solve this puzzle?*

*- Sir...* - muttered the maiden. - *Not long ago you withdraw from a package, from a basket, from... And i thought i could keep it for myself, sir...*

*- Emily,* - sir Carter, - *I asked you to get rid of the cat. Or is this place not worthy?*

*- I like my place, sir. Very much like, sir. Please, don't worry sir, i will kick it out in a second, sir.*

*- Wait, Emmy!* - sir Carter caught her elbow. - *Let not be so cruel with our smaller brothers. Take it to a post office for my friend sir Backford, Brian Backford. Will you? All right. Now go!*

*- Now, sir? It is late, and dark, and the post office is closed...* - Emily looked rather scared for herself.

*- Ok, Emily, but you do it right away in the morning. I don't want to put a surprise back for my friend.*

***

*- Sir Backford doesn't appreciate cats,* - said some mister Lesley.

*- What should I do with the basket then?* - asked Kimberly.

*- Anything you like, just keep away from the master,* - hissed the valet at the maiden.

*- Can I leave it for myself?*

*- Eat and sleep with it as you please!* - quipped mister Lesley. - *This Monday the master ordered to keep house free of any cats. So you'd better hide it, understood?*

*- Yes, sir. Will do my best!*

*- You will.*

***

*- Missis Wibley-Willington, would you be so kind to treat with with your best ale,* - asked sir Reginald Kingsbury.

*- Sir Kingsbury, just a minute, just a second...* - cackled the mistress of the "Green beard".

*- You know, dear Catherine, i heard a rumor,* - sir Kingsbury began from afar, savoring foam in a mug, - *that young gentlemen favor your pub.*

*- Yes, dear Reggie, young people as well as noble sirs appreciate my ale.* - replied missis Wibley-Willington proudly.

*- Was in not long ago,* - sir Kingsbury's curly hair almost touched missis Wibley-Willington's bonnet. - *that you served the suitors of my daughters, sir Ashman, sir Backford, sir Carter, sir Double, and sir Exton?*

*- Yes, sir Kingsbury, this rumor is true as is the one about my ale. These young gentlemen as i remember praised a lot our London weather and our Queen.* - she smiled mysteriously.

*- Sounds like they did enjoy this place. Did anything interesting happen that evening?* - asked sir Kingsbury innocently.

*- It was a usual evening,* - claimed missis Wibley-Willington. - *Why would you ask, dear Reggie?*

*- Oh you know young ladies. They see ghosts in every shadow. My darling daughters say their suitors avoid each other. My little birds cannot leave them in a single room for a single munite. They behave like cat with dog. You know what i mean. I am tired of "Something happened to my Brian", "My Adam got sick", "My David behaves strangely, he doesn't love me anymore". All this buzzing in my ears. What got into them, dear Catherine?*

*- Something for sure got into them,* - missis Wibley-Willington covered her giggling with her hand.

*- Tell me, my dear, I am strong enough to accept the truth.* - sir Kingsbury got up on his feet, showing his bulky belly as an armor.

*- Dear Reggie, trust me, the most terrible what might have happened to them was probably an acute allergy to cats.*

*- Acute? To cats?* - incredulously asked sir Kingsbury.

*- Well, they could decide who would pay, so i gave them a kitten for a help. The one who has it in a month will pay a debt.*

*- And what in the debt precisely?*

*- 30 pounds.*

*- Quite some debt, i would say. A gentleman always pays his debts!* - sir Kingsbury got upset.

*- There were 5 of them. They disappointed missis Wibley-Willington,* - sniffed missis Wibley-Willington.

*- And these irresponsible gentlemen dared to offer their hands to my daughters! I won't leave it like this!* - howled sir Kingsbury.

The old gentleman banged a bar table with his mug.

*- Hush, dear Reggie,* - cooled him down the hostess of "Green Beard". - *I am sure young people will realise the seriousness of paying off the debt till the last penny.*

*- I hope so, highly hope, or...* - sir Kingsbury was heavily breathing, both from anger and fresh ale.

*- No or, my dear,* - missis Wibley-Willington winked to sir Kingsbury, and poured another pint into his mug.

***

*- Kimberly?* - called sir Backford.

*- Yes, sir?*

*- Have you seen Lesley? I have to be by my uncle for supper, and don't know whether my evening suit is ready.*

*- Sir, i think i saw mister Lesley down in kitchen. Shall I call him, sir?* - proposed the maiden.

*- I will go with you. It is a matter of extreme importance. You know your master's life is unfortunately dependent on his uncle,* - doomly said sir Backford.

He followed his maiden to a ground floor, and started opening door by door, until suddenly met something he didn't expect to see in his house.

*- Sir,* - muttered the maiden, - *this is just my room. No mister Lesley can be there.*

*- What...is...it?* - sir Backford backed away.

*- What is there, sir?* - Kimberly's eyes widened.

*- It!* - sir Backford was pointing at a basket, where a fluffy white ball purred sweetly in its dream.

*- Sir, it is a kitten...*

*- Kimberly, don't tell it's a kitten!*

*- I am sorry, sir...*

*- Kimberly, don't tell me "sir"! Who brought it? When he brought it?* - sir Backford's jaw trembled.

*- A boy, a courier, sir. Last Monday or Tuesday, sir. Sorry, sir... Mister Lesley said you don't want any cat at home. But Zoe is so cute, so i let myself...*

*- You gave it a NAME?! Kimberly!* - sir Backford's jaw were about to bite.

*- No cats, sir! My fault, sir. I will take it out. Leave it somewhere. Cats live on a street...* - the maiden rushed to take the basket away from the master's eyes and teeth.

*- No, Kimberly!...* - sir Backford started to think more rationally. - *This one deserves a better live. You mensioned your sister works by me close friend sir Adam Ashman?*

*- Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.*

*- It's ok, Kimberly. You can call me sir again. Just stop saying "sorry".*

*- Yes, sir,* - nodded the maiden.

*- What a wonderful idea it would be, if you present this fluffy ball to your sister, don't you think so, Kimberly?* - sir Backford was smiling again.

*- Yes, sir. She would like it!*

*- All right then,* - waved sir Backford to her. - *I need to find Lesley. I am late! L-e-s-l-e-y!!!*

***

*- Where is my wallet?* - sir Ashman darted around a room.

*- Here, sir,* - a servant fluttered with a thin wallet in his hands.

*- Thanks, Evans, you are always at hand. I must get to a bank first. Then i have an appointment with Victoria in "May Pie". What a nonsense this cafe! You won't believe, Evans.*

*- Won't believe, sir.*

*- They serve only desserts. All kinds of sweet desserts. Pies, cakes, cookies... What is so delicious about them, ha? Roast beef is a food! When i get married, I will wean Victoria from eating pies five times a day! You will see, Evans...* - sir Ashman tended to make big plans around his marriage.

*- Yes, sir, your cab is waiting.*

*- Right on time! Perfect, Evans! Off I am,* - this time sir Ashman didn't forget his wallet.

***

*- This chocolate brioche is marvelous,* - purried miss Victoria Kingsbury. - *Please, try it. Just one piece.*

*- You are better than all brioches in the world,* - sir Ashman tried to shake off a piece hung menacingly an inch from him.

*- Just this one,* - insisted young lady.

*- I am about to burst,* - sir Ashman moved away from a threatening spoon.

*- Well, try then a piece of savarin with pineapple,* - miss Victoria continued fight for her victory.

*- Sweetheart, darling, whatever. I'll steal stars from the sky, but not savarin, not with pineapple!*

*- You make me sad, my dear Adam. You have been making me sad often lately,* - she squeezed out a tear.

Sir Ashman wanted to say something, but brioche found its way though an open mouth.

***

*- Evans, I cannot endure this treatment! Victoria was born specifically to make me suffer...* - sir Ashman experiences hard times on a couch.

*- I doubt it, sir.*

*- No, i can prove it. Today i was forced to swallow a prune pie, then corn fritters. And I couldn't dodge chocolate brioche.*

*- I feel sorry for you, sir.*

*- I feel sorry for myself too, Evans. Anything happened why I was away?*

*- Sir Kingsbury's valet called, passed a invitation from sir Kingsbury to come for a supper this Saturday.*

*- Good, sir Kingsbury likes meat and is a mature hunter, he knows what should be a proper english supper.*

*- Then miss Kimberly visited her sister, our cook Margo.*

*- Miss?...* - sir Ashman got curious. - *Ah! That child. Serves at my friend Backford. How does she find it there?*

*- Sir Backford is a noble gentleman, sir,* - confirmed Evans.

*- Definitely, my best friend,* - agreed sir Ashman.

*- Miss Kimberly presented missis Margo a kitten, sir.*

*- Yes, sweet... What?!* - jumped sir Ashman - *A kitten? How?*

*- I believe this is the one missis Wibley-Willington asked to take care of, sir,* - Evans was close with his master. He knew about that small incident in "Green Beard", as well as many other incidents. But he was loyal and helpful, so it paid off.

*- Call Margo, now!*

*- Yes, sir, coming.*

Evans vanished from the room. The same moment there was a weak knock, and a frightened maid sneaked in.

*- Ah, Kimberly, dear. Wanted to have a word with you about one kitten.*

*- A kitten, sir?*

*- Yes, the one your sister kindly presented to you.*

*- Oh, sir,* - the maid blushed. - *That kitten... It is so innocent, like angel. And fluffy. It likes milk. I keep it in my room. Hope, you don't mind, sir?*

*- No-no, of course not, my dear,* - sir Ashman straightened his jacket and cleaned his throat. - *Everything is great. Perfect. But you know what, my dear? I afraid your room is too small and you have work to day. So this fluffy ball has to stay along the whole day. Don't you find it cruel?*

*- Yes, sir,* - Kimberly looked a bit incredulously.

*- You know dear, I have a wonderful idea,* - sir Ashman straightened his jacket again before the next attack. - *I have a friend, sir Exton, big fan of cats and kittens. Sir Edward Exton, he lives next to Hyde Part. He would be happy to share his house with our little angel.*

*- Yes, sir,* - was a sad reply.

*- Lovely, my dear. I knew you would understand. What a wonderful weather today! What a ... dense fog, em...*

***

*- Sir?*

A cheerful whistle was heard in response.

*- Sir?*

*- Yes?*

*- There is a package from sir Ashman. Looks like he found your cat, sir!*

*- Oh...*

***

Not every cat, especially in such a young age, could boast of or rather complain about a rapid change of home sweet home. Our little angel got to know north and south, east and west of London that month. Its new master was so happy to greet him, and so in a rush to share his happiness with his friend. His friend was in turn eager to share with his one. And it turned out, that the circle of friends got complete. But the joy emerged and emerged - and again friends confess their friendship and were sealing it with a basket with the fluffy angel along the chain.

Days and nights ran their own baton, bringing closer the day missis Wibley-Willington would meet that one, who dared to be a gentleman.

***

*- Adam, i know you are awake!* - miss Victoria Kingsbury burst into a room. - *Evans can hide you from aunts and uncles, but not from me!*

*- Honey, you're an early bird! What a nice surpr...* - i, s and e letters froze on sir Ashman's lips, as he spotted black button-eyes on a fluffy ball in Victoria's hands.

*- I know you are happy to see me. By the way, it is long past noon. Look what a miracle I found at your door!*

*- L-o-v-e-l-y,* - gasped sir Ashman.

*- Adam, do you like it? Let's keep him! Please, please, please... When we get married, we will live together - you, me, and this charming angel.*

*- Y-e-s, m-y d-e-a-r...*

*- Are you alright, my love?* - Victoria passed the basket with the kitten to Evans and rushed to her Adam.

*- No worries, it's all right,* - whispered sir Ashman.

*- Let's go outside! The sun is shining again,* - proposed young lady.

*- Sun?!* - sir Ashman looked lost.

*- Yes, sir, sun. May i suggest "Green Beard". I heard they have a nice ale.*

*- You think so, Evans?* - sir Ashman kept his look at a fluffy ball.

*- Absolutely, sir! Best ale in the city. What a sunny weather, sir! And today is the first day of August, sunny summer weather, sir.*

*- I afraid you are right, Evans,* - sighed sir Ashman, the day arrived. He straightened his jacket for the last time in this story. - *Where is my wallet, Evans?*

*- Here it is, sir. And the basket, sir.*

*- Thank you Evans, let's go my dear!*

***

*- Victoria, dear, give me a minute, want to check with missis Wibley-Willington regarding her ale.*

*- You have the minute. We can always go to "May Pie".*

*- No-no, dear. We can trust Evans, I sense good about ale today, you'll see!*

Sir Adam seized the basket, leaving miss Kingsbury outside.

*- Missis Wibley-Willington?* - whispered sir Ashman. - *May I steal you for a minute?*

*- Ah, sir Ashman! Glad to see you today. And you got the basket with you. Twice as glad.*

*- Yes,* - confirmed sir Ashman. - *I came as agreed, with the kitten, safe and sound. Here is your 30 pounds. Forgive me generously, dear missis Wibley-Willington. I behaved like the last fool!*

*- Oh dear, don't say so! You are a true gentleman. Gentlemen never act like fools. And you know what?* - whinked she. - *To cheer you up this sunny day I have a big mug of your favourite "Porter". Oh, I almost forgot, your friends are here. What a surprise, right?*

*- Indeed,* - sir Ashman smiled tightly. - *You are so kind, missis Wibley-Willington. I will call Victoria.*

***

*- Adam, old chap, you are just in time!* - greeted sir Backford newcomers.

*- Brian! Conor! David! Edward! So glad to see you all,* - replied sir Ashman.

He nodded to ladies - Victoria's sisters - and got charming smiles in return. Then he grimly smiled to his friends. Sir Carter pushed two more chairs for the last pair arrived and winked at Victoria.

*- Adam, how nice that you joined us,* - sir Carter raised his mug. - *I was about to say, what a luck our ladies are with us!*

*- Yes, my friend, we have amazing ladies with us,* - sir Ashman kept mourning his 30 pounds. - *Remarkable story has happened with us today, my friends. My beloved Victoria, you won't believe, found a basket with a kitten at my door.*

Sir Ashman casted a stern glance over his companions. He expected to reveal the culprit. However non of them lowered eyes, but looked at the narrator with mute surprise.

*- I wonder,* - said sir Carter. - *My fiancee also found a kitten at my door this morning!*

Sir Double gave his friends a hostile look.

*- Oh...* - commented sir Exton.

An avalanche of giggling flush the conversation.

*- It seems to me, my friends,* - broke through giggling sir Backford, - *our ladies have an interesting story to tell.*

*- Oh well, do you really think we have anything to say?* - waved Victoria away.

Second wave of giggling surged from sisters of miss Victoria.

*- So why are you laughing,* - insisted sir Backford. - *Who can explain me the appearance of five - and not a one - kittens? I am not a professor of astronomy, but assure you - there is no cat rain! Kittens don't fall out of the sky at gentlemen's doors.*

*- Oh...* - added sir Exton.

*- Dear Brian,* - said Victoria sternly. - *Do you, gentlemen, think our dearest papa would allow marriage with a scrooge? Do you think it is fair for only one of us to join with her true love? My Adam is definitely a gentleman and pays his debts.*

*- My dear,* - sir Ashman hugged Victoria. - *I am the gentleman from head to toes, and don't need a cat to prove it. And my friends are all gentlemen. Am I right, my friends?*

*- Right! True words!* - everyone raised his mug.

*- Oh, Adam,* - sobbed Victoria.

*- So let's drink for our loved ones!* - sir Backford jumped to save his friend from lisping. - *And this wonderful weather!*

*- For our ladies!*
